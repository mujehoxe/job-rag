      "content": "The 15 Best Social Media Sites (& Platforms) in 2024 Skip to content The 15 Best Social Media Sites (& Platforms) in 2024 by James Everett Youngblood on Sep 24, 2024 Wondering which social media sites your business, brand, or blog should be on in 2024? You\u2019ve come to the right place. Social media platforms are always jockeying for dominance, so it can be surprisingly difficult to find articles with the most up-to-date information on Google. The good news is I\u2019ve done the legwork for you. As a writer and editor, I\u2019ve used many of these platforms to promote my writing, find clients and connect with people in my industry. Below, you\u2019ll find the freshest data from sites like Statista to help you get the lowdown on the top social media sites around the world. We\u2019ll look at standout features for each social networking platform, go over who should (and should not) use them, and provide insights that\u2019ll help you determine which ones are best for your business, brand, or blog. Let\u2019s dig in. 1. Facebook Facebook is the largest social media platform in the world. But just because almost 90% of its daily active social media users live outside North America doesn\u2019t mean this social platform isn\u2019t popular in the U.S. Seven in ten U.S. adults use Facebook , and more than half of Americans check multiple times daily, sharing posts composed of text, photos, videos, and GIFs that other Facebook users comment on, share, and react to. Quick Snapshot Headquarters: Menlo Park, California, USA Founded: 2004 Monthly Active Users: 2.9 Billion Standout Features & Functionality Audience Insights gives small businesses the power to leverage Facebook\u2019s massive pool of aggregated data to help them reach their ideal audience with Facebook ads. Facebook 360 allows businesses to upload panoramic-style photos from a smartphone, creating immersive, interactive experiences for their followers . Facebook Live gives influencers an interactive medium for connecting with their audience. Who Should Use Facebook? Just about every audience is on Facebook , and it is the most popular social media network for seniors \u2014 a rapidly growing demographic on the site. Who Shouldn\u2019t Use Facebook? Although Facebook dominates social media usage, if you\u2019re in an industry that elicits unhappy or angry feelings, then your message may not be well received on Facebook. Final Word on Facebook Facebook advertising\u2019s massive reach and powerful social media marketing capabilities make it a no-brainer for most businesses (just make sure you set up a business page, if you haven\u2019t already). And if you\u2019re a content creator (whether it\u2019s a blog post , infographic, or an article for a client ), Facebook is one of the best social media platforms to share content. Back to Top 2. YouTube When it comes to social networking sites, YouTube dominates video content sharing. This massive video-sharing platform lets users post, comment on, and upvote or downvote music videos, TV shows, vlogs, educational content, live streams, movie trailers, and more. YouTube users can also subscribe to other users\u2019 social media channels and add videos to playlists. This popular social media platform functions as a massive search engine (2nd only to Google), making SEO an important consideration for content creators. Quick Snapshot Headquarters: San Bruno, California, USA Founded: 2005 Monthly Active Users: 2.49 Billion Standout Features YouTube Cards visually enhance links to other videos and playlists, making your social media content more interactive. They can appear at any specified time during your video. YouTube Live allows you to stand out by creating an engaging experience with your audience. After reaching 1,000 followers, a social media user can post text, images, GIFs, live videos, and more within the Community tab to further connect with their audience. Who Should Use YouTube? Tons of businesses have leveraged this top social media site to reach potential customers successfully. Here are 50 content ideas to get any business started. Who Shouldn\u2019t Use YouTube? An astounding 500+ hours of video is uploaded to YouTube every minute. If you\u2019re not committed to producing high-quality social media content, you won\u2019t gain traction. Final Word on YouTube Chances are your audience is regularly tuning in to this massively popular social networking website to be entertained, educated, and informed. Will they find you there? Back to Top 3. WhatsApp In a crowded messaging app market (QQ, Telegram, Snapchat, etc.) WhatsApp stands as the most popular, with more monthly active social media users than Facebook Messenger (both are owned by Facebook). Users can send text and voice messages or make voice and video calls for free with this mobile social media app . However, unlike the app Viber, users cannot call non-app users\u2019 numbers. WhatsApp Business is a standalone app available on desktop, and many business owners use it as a handy customer service solution. Quick Snapshot Headquarters: Mountain View, California, USA Founded: 2009 Monthly Active Users : 2 Billion Standout Features Free international text, voice, and video messaging (video chat with up to 4 people). WhatsApp Business provides messaging tools for connecting with customers, including automated greeting and away messages, the ability to reuse messages for quick replies, labels for organizing contacts and chats, catalogs to show off your products and services, and a profile page with your basic business info. Document sharing allows for easily sharing spreadsheets, slideshows, and other documents up to 100 MB (also free!). Who Should Use WhatsApp? Businesses that want to offer quickly accessible customer service, including local businesses offering delivery. Who Shouldn\u2019t Use WhatsApp? If your customers aren\u2019t likely to use the app, then it won\u2019t work because both parties must have it to connect. Final Word on WhatsApp It\u2019s easy to see why WhatsApp has become such a popular social networking app with small businesses . Check out this HubSpot article for WhatsApp marketing ideas . Back to Top 4. Facebook Messenger Messenger , originally Facebook Chat, is a standalone messaging app and platform. No Facebook account is necessary to use this social networking site to communicate via text messages, voice, or video chat. More than an instant messaging app, users can also share photos, videos, stickers, and other file formats. Messenger was recently redesigned to be lightweight and fast \u2014 deprioritizing a number of features, including chatbots that had become integral to many businesses\u2019 customer communication strategy. Quick Snapshot Headquarters: Menlo Park, California, USA Founded: 2011 Monthly Active Users: 980 Million Standout Features US users can send and receive money through Messenger by connecting it to their debit card or PayPal account. Location sharing (remember Foursquare and its check-ins?) makes it easy for your friends or customers to find you. Messenger Rooms is a video chat feature similar to Zoom that allows up to 50 participants at a time. Business solutions, like purchase tracking, notifications, and connecting customers with your customer service representatives make it easy to serve your customers. Who Should Use Facebook Messenger? Businesses whose customers are already on Facebook (and probably on Messenger), that want to offer their customers an easy and convenient way to reach them. Who Shouldn\u2019t Use Facebook Messenger? Those not able or willing to respond to customer inquiries within Messenger\u2019s allotted 24-hour window (prevents spamming), may want to consider another solution. Final Word on Facebook Messenger For a time, chatbots were a big social media strategy on Messenger. Those days are over, with a shift toward user satisfaction. Respect your customers\u2019 inbox. Back to Top 5. WeChat WeChat (Weixin) is one of the most popular social media sites to come out of China. Owned by Tencent, the parent company of QQ and QZone, this app does a little bit of everything. It\u2019s a messaging, social media, and mobile payment app rolled into one, and users also play games, shop, and access government services through the social media platform. Like other social media apps, users can also share photos, make video calls, and text. Advertisers on WeChat benefit from Facebook-esque customer data collection. Quick Snapshot Headquarters: Shenzhen, China Founded: 2011 Monthly Active Users: 1.35 Billion Standout Features WeChat Pay allows users to shop and make money transfers. Automated replies create a smooth customer service experience. A customer history chat log is available for easy reference when corresponding with clients. WeChat Shop platforms allow businesses to set up online stores that leverage features like WeChat Pay, phone number and address collection, retargeting, and customer service capabilities. Who Should Use WeChat? If your audience is in or from China \u2014 including tourists, students, and expats \u2014 then this all-in-one social media service is worth a look. Who Shouldn\u2019t Use WeChat? Foreign businesses must go through a 3rd party agency to advertise on WeChat, which is a lot of hassle unless you\u2019re serious about reaching Chinese audiences. Final Word on WeChat WeChat is a huge platform with tons of organic and paid marketing options for brands and businesses. Back to Top 6. Instagram Instagram is a video and photo-sharing social platform where users upload photos and short videos, often adding filters and other effects before sharing them with family and friends. It\u2019s owned by Facebook, which provides robust marketing data for reaching your audience. Well-suited to influencer marketing, it\u2019s the perfect place to show off products and tell visually centered stories about your business. Whether that\u2019s e-commerce or personal training, you\u2019ll find that Instagram users are ready to buy.
